# Binance Futures Trading Bot

This project is a simplified trading bot developed as part of the internship application. It interacts with the Binance Futures Testnet to place market, limit, and stop-limit orders for USDT-margined futures (e.g., BTCUSDT). Built using Python and the `python-binance` library, it features both a command-line interface (CLI) and a Streamlit web interface.

---

## Features

- **Order Types**: Supports market, limit, and stop-limit (bonus) orders for both BUY and SELL sides.  
- **Binance Testnet**: Uses the testnet URL (`https://testnet.binancefuture.com`) for safe, simulated trading.  
- **Interfaces**: CLI (`futures_bot.py`) and Streamlit UI (`streamlit_bot.py`) with input validation and clear output.  
- **Logging**: Logs API requests, responses, and errors to `futures_trading_bot.log` and console.  
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs and API errors gracefully.
